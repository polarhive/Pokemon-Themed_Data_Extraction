> You need to return your findings to Professor Oak in the form of three PokÃ©dex Data Files (CSV files):

1. Basic_Pokemon_Stats.csv
2. Pokemon_Item_Inventory.csv
3. Battle_Performance_Stats.csv

Part 3 is partially incomplete.

We shall try fixing it before the 6PM deadline but this video is recorded at 5:20.
